                <h2>The Problem:</h2>
                <br>
                <p>When completing a survey for the course on what features people wanted
                    to present on. It was found that there
                    was not a high number of our peers that knew about ThreeJS.

                <h2>The Solution:</h2>
                <p>We sought to create a small demonstration on some of the capabilities that
                    a developer/user could utilize when creating with ThreeJS.

                <h2>Brainstorming</h2>
                <br>
                <p>We decided on creating a couple ideas on how we wanted our project to turn out.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    First, we had to figure out what parts of ThreeJS we wanted to show off. For that, we
                    decided to showcase how easy it was to create a scene, import meshes, create lights, and
                    import blender models into your projects/webpages using the GLTFLoader utility.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>After we figured out a basic idea of what we wanted to show, we created a basic
                    wireframe that would give us an achievable goal to set towards when creating the
                    webpage.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="wireframe" class="img-container">
            </div>

            <div class="brain">
                <br>
                <p>After creating the wireframe we skipped right to creating our first prototype.
                    Our presentation date on the topic was closing in so we had to expedite the creation
                    process quite a bit.
                </p>

                    Testing
                </h2>
                <br>
                <p>After the prototype was complete we moved onto testing our model with some other fellow students.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We asked about 10 people who wanted to remain anonymous what they though about the interaction and usability of
                    the website. And what they might do with that kind of tool.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Some useful suggestions that we noted down: </strong></p>
                <br>
                <ul class="suggestionul">
                    <li class="suggestionli">More animations between certain interactions on the page.</li>
                    <li class="suggestionli">A tutorial popup on load on the page (it wasn't very clear that the scene on the index page could be interacted with).</li>
                    <li class="suggestionli">An alternative to the pop up being a visible reminder/notification.</li>
                    <li class="suggestionli">More styling on the second page to demonstrate a real world occurrence of something being displayed.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>Findings & Recommendations:</h3>
                <br>
                <p>From the testing that we did with some of our users, we could then form a plan on where to go next if we wanted to continue with
                    this project. We found that implementing some of the usability heuristics would be the best course of action. Some of them are covered, such as visibility of system
                    status. That can be done by the users browser. Our showcase doesn't provide a service that the user would need a message for. Flexibility and efficiency of use could
                    be something that is looked at. We could create more flexibility in the page and increase the efficiency of the user experience. There is one heuristic that stands out to
                    us above all else. That being help/documentation. From the suggestions that we received, it would seem that we need more help documentation when
                    it comes to our page. It was not apparent that the user could interact with the page at first, and could have gone unnoticed if they weren't told to
                    explore the page further. We would recommend for this project moving forward to apply more UX laws and usability heuristics in order for a much smoother
                    user experience.
